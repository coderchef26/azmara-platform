# @azmara/core

Reactive engine — signals, effects, and computed values.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm add @azmara/core
```

## Signal

A reactive value container. Any effect that reads `.get()` while active will re-run when the value changes.

```typescript
import { Signal } from "@azmara/core";

const count = new Signal(0);
count.set(1);
console.log(count.get()); // 1
console.log(count.peek()); // 1 — reads without subscribing
```

## effect

Runs a function immediately and re-runs whenever any Signal read inside it changes. Returns a disposer.

```typescript
import { Signal, effect } from "@azmara/core";

const name = new Signal("Aroha");

const dispose = effect(() => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name.get()}`);
});
// → Hello, Aroha

name.set("Tane");
// → Hello, Tane
```

## computed

A read-only Signal whose value is derived from other Signals.

```typescript
import { Signal, computed } from "@azmara/core";

const price = new Signal(100);
const gst = computed(() => price.get() * 0.15);

console.log(gst.get()); // 15
price.set(200);
console.log(gst.get()); // 30
```

## subscribe

Listen to a Signal from outside the reactive system — useful for bridging to React, Vue, or any non-reactive code.

```typescript
import { Signal } from "@azmara/core";

const price = new Signal(100);

const unsubscribe = price.subscribe((value) => {
  console.log(`price changed to ${value}`);
});

price.set(200); // → price changed to 200

unsubscribe(); // stop listening
```

## Safety

The scheduler uses a generation counter to prevent effects from running more than once per flush cycle. An effect that reads and writes the same signal will run at most twice — the re-queue is deduplicated, preventing unbounded loops.

```typescript
const s = new Signal(0);

// Safe — deduplicated by the scheduler, never runs unboundedly
effect(() => {
  s.get();
  s.set(s.peek() + 1);
});
```

## API Reference

### `Signal<T>`

| Method | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `get()` | `T` | Read value and subscribe current effect |
| `set(value)` | `void` | Update value and notify subscribers |
| `peek()` | `T` | Read value without subscribing |
| `subscribe(fn)` | `() => void` | Register a callback, returns unsubscribe function |

### Functions

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `effect(fn)` | Run `fn` reactively, returns disposer |
| `computed(fn)` | Create a derived read-only Signal |
