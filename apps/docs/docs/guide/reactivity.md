# Reactivity

Azmara's reactive system is built around three primitives: **Signal**, **effect**, and **computed**.

## Mental model

Think of it like a spreadsheet:
- **Signal** = a cell with a value
- **computed** = a formula cell that derives from other cells
- **effect** = a side-effect that runs when cells it reads change (like a chart that updates)

## Signals are the source of truth

```typescript
const price = new Signal(100);
const quantity = new Signal(3);
```

## Computed values derive from signals

```typescript
const subtotal = computed(() => price.get() * quantity.get());
const gst = computed(() => subtotal.get() * 0.15);
const total = computed(() => subtotal.get() + gst.get());
```

## Effects react to changes

```typescript
effect(() => {
  console.log(`Total: $${total.get().toFixed(2)}`);
});
// → Total: $345.00

price.set(200);
// → Total: $690.00
```

## Automatic dependency tracking

You don't declare dependencies manually. The reactive system tracks which Signals are read during each effect or computed run — and only re-runs when those specific signals change.

## Connecting to React

Use `useSignal` from `@azmara/ui` to bridge Signals into React components:

```tsx
import { useSignal } from "@azmara/ui";

function TotalDisplay({ total }: { total: Signal<number> }) {
  const value = useSignal(total);
  return <span>${value.toFixed(2)}</span>;
}
```
